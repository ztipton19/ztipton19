## Introduction:
Welcome to my GitHub page! I am currently an M.S. graduate student in Economic Analysis which focuses heavily on all the aspects of being a data scientist. I also hold an M.S. in Biology-Stream Ecology and a B.S.A. in Environmental, Soil, and Water Science. 

Here I present my data analyist portfolio where I demonstrate my ability to gather, clean, and manipulate data along with applying traditional and machine learning statistical methods to my analysis. 

You can view my resume here.

My graduate thesis in Biology can be viewed [here](https://github.com/ztipton19/ms-thesis-biology/tree/main).
